./example_data
---
- scripts for creating the example database of MSA and homologs (using pipeline #1)

./matrices
---
- notebook for downloading and processing substitution matrices (using pipeline #2)
- Note - not all matrices are useful, but I created them to try various experiments. Their main use would be in the `aln_asym_sum_of_pairs.py` conservation scoring script.
